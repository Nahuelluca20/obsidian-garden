## The begins

When I started learning to program in 2018 I was 16 years old since that time the tech industry changed a lot, we had a pandemic, massive layoffs and most recently AI.

I started as a Frontend developer to become a full-stack developer but now the paths are confusing. We have a lot of things to learn and I want to learn it all, but time is an issue, I have to focus on a few things to do something that has some value.

## Things I want to learn

**Best programmer**: I want to keep improving in my career as a programmer and keep growing.

**AI engineering:** I want to learn how to create applications using AI or LLMs, how to create AI agents and create AI-based products.

**AI in deep:** I want to learn how these models work in depth, I don't want them to be a pandora's box for me.

## What will I do?

I will investigate more about it because everything that is happening today in the tech world with AI is very exciting.

But I think I'm leaning towards AI, I think it's the future and I think the best way to prepare for that future is to learn about AI in a deeper way to have a better understanding.

## Next steps

This is the next thing I will do to test which area I want to delve into first:

1. I will create an AI Agent to learn how it works and see how it interests me. It will test how to create things with AI and with code.
2. I will watch the Andrej Karpathy video [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=3745s&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) to understand more about LLMs.
3. I will finish the book `Build LLMs from scratch` which teaches about LLMs in a more technical and in-depth way.
4. I will continue to learn more about software engineering.

I believe that with these steps I will be able to figure out what I want to work on and spend my time on.
