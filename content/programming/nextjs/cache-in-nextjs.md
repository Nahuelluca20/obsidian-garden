Next.js have a different ways to cache data and improve the performance in out applications.

| **Mechanism**            | **What**                   | **Where** | **Purpose**                                     | **Duration**                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Request Memoization](#) | Return values of functions | Server    | Re-use data in a React Component tree           | Per-request lifecycle           |
| [Data Cache](#)          | Data                       | Server    | Store data across user requests and deployments | Persistent (can be revalidated) |
| [Full Route Cache](#)    | HTML and RSC payload       | Server    | Reduce rendering cost and improve performance   | Persistent (can be revalidated) |
| [Router Cache](#)        | RSC Payload                | Client    | Reduce server requests on navigation            | User session or time-based      |

By default Next.js will use cache in our application for reduce costs. By default Next.js use `static render` and cache `data request`

## Request Memoization

Next.js extends the [`fetch` API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#fetch) to automatically **memoize** requests that have the same URL and options. So if we use a same fetch call in multiple places we execute it once.

If we have a several calls to the same url with the same params we can use the `request memoization` for reduce the calls and `HIT` the cache in memory.

The cache lasts the lifetime of a server request until the React component tree has finished rendering.

## Data Cache

Next.js has a built-in Data Cache that **persists** the result of data fetches across incoming **server requests** and **deployments**.

> Whether the data is cached or uncached, the requests are always memoized to avoid making duplicate requests for the same data during a React render pass.

Next.js handles fetch requests like this:

- With `force-cache`: checks Data Cache first; if cached, returns and memoizes. If not, fetches data, caches, and memoizes.
- Without cache (`no-store` or no cache option): always fetches fresh data and memoizes.
- In all cases, requests are memoized to avoid duplicates during the same render pass.

The data will persist until we revalidate again we can revalidate the data with `On-demand Revalidation` and `Time-based Revalidation`.

> **Differences between the Data Cache and Request Memoization**
> While both caching mechanisms help improve performance by re-using cached data, the Data Cache is persistent across incoming requests and deployments, whereas memoization only lasts the lifetime of a request.

## Full Route Cache

The default behavior of Next.js is to cache the rendered result (React Server Component Payload and HTML) of a route on the server. This applies to statically rendered routes at build time, or during revalidation.

> **What is the React Server Component Payload?**
> The React Server Component Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM.
